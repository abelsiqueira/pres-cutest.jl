Hello all, my name is Abel, I'm a professor at the Federal University of Paran√°,
in Brazil.
This is a joint work with professor Orban, which is a culmination of our work
with some Julia packages.
I present a suggested workflow for writing optimization algorithms based on
agile methodology. Then, I present a framework composed of some packages we
created for Julia, which are very useful. I present a little about CUTEst, which
is where we did most work, and a practical example of the application of the the
workflow using the framework.
Finally I show some possible future projects.

The following quotes are a good description of the workflow.
First, by Donald Knuth, which warns us of the priorities of software
development, and below by Kent Beck, associated with the Agile methodology:
make it work, that is, solve the problem,
make it right, which we'll interpret here as make sure it doesn't break,
and make it fast, which is the efficiency part of an algorithm.

The most known implementation of this methodology is Test Driven Development,
in which one creates a significant test for which the current code fails, then
writes sufficient codes to fix the test, without breaking any other tests, and
then refactor the code clarifying or improving it.

Usually, the tests are small parts of the larger code.
